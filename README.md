# Carnival Demo - Application

This project demonstrates a basic application that uses Carnival.  This is a Groovy application that contains a `main` method that does not do anything particularly useful.  The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the basics of Carnival vines, graph models, and graph methods.  It further demonstrates the use of a Carnival library.
